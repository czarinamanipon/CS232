1.What instruction is “int a, b, c, d;” converted to? 

subl $16,%esp

2.Does “int a, b, c, d;” shrink or grow the stack? How many bytes are allocated on stack for a, b, c, and d? Explain them using instruction from question 1.

The declaration of the int variables shrinks the stack because the assembly instruction subtracts 16 bits from the top of the stack.
JYM: nope, subl 16 grows the stack

3.What instruction is “b=2;” converted to? How is the address of variable b formed in the instruction?
movl $2,-8(%ebp)
The address of variable b is 8 bits lower than the address of %ebp.

4.Based on the instructions converted from four assignments, can we claim the declaration order determines the allocation order? For instance, a is declared before b, does it mean a is to be allocated before b on stack? Verify your theory by changing the declaration to “int a, c, b, d;”

Declaration order does in fact determine allocation order. Even if b is initialized before c, it is allocated at a lower address than c because c was declared first.
