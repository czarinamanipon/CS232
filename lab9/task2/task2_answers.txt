#1: What function does the line i = (addr >> 2) & 7; serve in the simulation?
The number stored in addr is shifted by 2 bits and the shared bits between that result and 7 (0b111) are stored in i.
This means that the offset = 2. The index is then found from the next three bits of the address using the three bit places in 7 as a mask.
#2: Compile and execute the direct-mapped cache simulator given in the task. Report the final number of hits and accesses output by the code. Also, based on the pattern of cache hits, estimate the hit rate of the given trace in the steady state (once the compulsory misses are accounted for).
Hits = 68, Accesses = 103, Hit ratio = 0.660194
Hit ratio steady estimate = 60 / 95 = 0.631578
#3: Our implementation of a simple, direct-mapped cache simulator only uses and maintains the tags in its simulation. Why is this enough to get a working example of cache behavior?
The cache does not need to store and save the full address of the memory after accessing it, only the tags to maintain its structure. The original address can be reconstructed
using the tag shifted 2 bits to the left and adding the index to it.
